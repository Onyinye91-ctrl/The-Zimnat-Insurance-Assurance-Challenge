# The-Zimnat-Insurance-Assurance-Challenge
n this hackathon your objective is to develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood for an insurance customer to churn - to seek an alternative insurer or simply drop out of the insurance market altogether. In light of the current pandemic, churn prediction can be used to offer targeted support and tailored services to certain customers vulnerable to churning. This means more people can continue to be covered when they most need it most and insurance companies can be more efficient at serving and retaining their customers.
